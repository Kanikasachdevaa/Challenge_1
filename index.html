						<ul>
							<li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
							<li>
								<strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
								University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
								known as the "National Youth Administration"
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1935 </strong> - Has to stop school and save up more
								money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
								starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All
								of this left scars on me."
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in
								the US Forestry Service
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1938 </strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret
								Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin
								Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who
								teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after
								the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
								asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
								malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
								Pathology
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from
								Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to
								head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his
								team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
								including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice
								each season, doubling wheat yields
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1953 </strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
								wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
								that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
								Mexico's wheat.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his
								high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in
								time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
								population
							</li>

							<li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries
								dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at
								Texas A&M University
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
								food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are
								the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
								land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because
								"we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long
								time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
								the best breeds."
							</li>

							<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
